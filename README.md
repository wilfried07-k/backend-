# EmploiCamer — Backend FastAPI

## Preview local

```powershell
cd backend
Copy-Item .env.example .env
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The backend uses SQLite locally when `DATABASE_URL` is unset. If the existing
local Oracle XE 11 client exists at its legacy path, it is detected automatically;
otherwise set `ORACLE_CLIENT_LIB_DIR`. The API is at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
and its interactive docs are at `/docs`.

## Déploiement preview en ligne

A Render Blueprint is included in `backend/render.yaml`; create a new Render Blueprint from the backend repository to create the Docker web service and its PostgreSQL database in Frankfurt. The free PostgreSQL tier is for short previews: Render deletes it after 30 days unless upgraded. The free web service can spin down while idle. These free-tier limits are documented by [Render](https://render.com/docs/free).

- `APP_ENV=preview`
- `DATABASE_URL` set to the isolated managed PostgreSQL database URL
- `SECRET_KEY` set to a fresh random value of at least 32 characters
- `CORS_ORIGINS` as a comma-separated list of allowed browser origins

The Docker image listens on the platform's `PORT`. PostgreSQL URLs beginning
with `postgres://` and `postgresql://` are supported. SQLite is for local use;
host container filesystems may be temporary.

Create the first administrator from the deployed backend's service shell after
the database variables are configured:

```bash
python -m app.create_admin
```

This prompts for the email, display name, and password. Admin accounts cannot be
created through public registration. All API routers except `/auth/register`
and `/auth/login` require a bearer token. Administrative routes require the
admin role; profile, company, job, application, messaging, alert, notification,
favorite, and interview operations check the associated user or company owner.

## Build Android preview

For local builds, put `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in
`afrijob-connect/.env.local`. For EAS cloud builds, set it in the EAS `preview`
environment because `.env.local` is ignored by Git and is not uploaded:

```bash
cd afrijob-connect
npx eas-cli env:set --name EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL --value https://YOUR-API-HOST --environment preview --visibility plaintext
npx eas-cli build --profile preview --platform android
```

The API URL is included in the app bundle and is public; never put credentials
in it. The existing `eas.json` uses the EAS `preview` environment and internal
distribution. EAS Build requires an authenticated Expo account and a configured
project. Use isolated preview data; do not point this build at production data.
